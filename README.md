# Calabash

## What is the project all about?

Calabash is a limited recreation of the bash shell, written to satisfy the requirements of the minishell project at the 42 London programming school.

## How do I run the project locally?

The project should run on Unix- or BSD-based systems (**Linux** or **macOS** should work well). If you wish to run the project on Windows, [setting up and using **WSL**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is recommended.

The best way to get a local copy of the project is to clone it using **Git** (which is itself most likely available for installation through your system's package manager, for example **apt** or **brew**).

To build the project, you'll need the following software, all of which should also be available for installation through your system's package manager:
- **Make**
- A C compiler of your choice (**gcc** or **clang** recommended)
- **GNU Readline**

Once you have installed the required software and cloned the project, open a terminal inside the root directory and use the following command to get started:

```
make run
```
